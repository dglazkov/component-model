<h3>Event Retargeting</h3>

<p>When an event is fired in a <span class=ref>shadow DOM subtree</span>, it either <em>escapes</em> out of the shadow tree during the capture, target, bubble, or default phases or it <em>is stopped</em> at the <span class=ref>shadow boundary</span>.</p>

<p>In the cases where event escapes the shadow tree, the event is <span class=ref>retargeted</span> to ensure that the original target-related information on the event object does not reveal information about the <span class=ref>shadow DOM subtree</span> beyond the boundary. Event retargeting is a process of computing a <dfn>relative target</dfn> for each <span class=ref>ancestorOrHost</span> of the node at which the event is dispatched.</p>

<p>To help with algorithm description, let's define the direction walking the ancestors of a node as <dfn>up</dfn> when traversing from child to parent, and <dfn>down</dfn> when traversing from parent to child.</p>

<p>In the context of events-related algorithms, all ancestor traversal crosses <span class=ref>shadow boundaries</span>.</p>

<p>The following <dfn>retargeting algorithm</dfn> must be used to determine relative targets:</p>

<div class=algorithm>
    <p>For each ancestor walking <span class=ref>up</span> from node's parent, compute its relative target:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If the ancestor is a <span class=ref>shadow boundary</span>, skip it</li>
            <li>If the previous ancestor was a <span class=ref>shadow boundary</span>, make the node its own <span class=ref>relative target</span>.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, use previous ancestor's <span class=ref>relative target</span>.</li>
        </ol>
</div>

<p>The retargeting process must occur prior to dispatch of an event.</p>

<p>At the time of event dispatch, for capturing, target, and bubbling phases, event's <code>target</code> and <code>currentTarget</code> must be set to the relative target.</p>

<p>The event must not be retargeted during the default phase of dispatch.</p>

<p>Upon completion of the event dispatch, the event's <code>target</code> and <code>currentTarget</code> must be returned to their values prior to the dispatch.</p>

<h3>Related Targets and Shadow DOM</h3>

<p>If an event has a <code>relatedTarget</code>, its value and extent of event dispatch must to be adjusted. In general:
<ol>
    <li>If <code>relatedTarget</code> and <code>target</code> are contained within a <span class=ref>shadow DOM subtree</span>, the event dispatch must be stopped at the <span class=ref>shadow boundary</span> of this subtree.</li>
    <li>If <code>relatedTarget</code> is separated from <code>target</code> by one or more <span class=ref>shadow boundaries</span>, it must be retargeted to the boundary that's closest to <code>target</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following algorithm must be used:</p>
<img src=resources/related-target-and-shadow-dom.svg width=400 height=400 align=right style="background-color: white">
<div class=algorithm>
<ol>
    <li>Find the <dfn>lowest common ancestor</dfn> of <code>target</code> and <code>relatedTarget</code>.</li>
    <li>If there is none, skip to step 6 in the algorithm.</li>
    <li>Looking at the ancestors of the <span class=ref>lowest common ancestor</span>, starting at its parent and walking <span class=ref>up</span>, find a <span class=ref>shadow boundary</span>. This is the <dfn>lowest common boundary</dfn>, the boundary of a <span class=ref>shadow DOM subtree</span> that encloses both <code>target</code> and <code>relatedTarget</code>.
    <li>If the <span class=ref>lowest common boundary</span> is not found, skip to step 6 in the algoritm.</li>
    <li>Limit event dispatch to the descendants of the <span class=ref>lowest common boundary</span>.</li>
    <li>If the <span class=ref>lowest common boundary</span> is still undetermined at this point, set it to be the farthest ancestor of the <code>relatedTarget</code>.</li>
    <li>Starting from <spann class=ref>lowest common boundary</span> and walking <span class=ref>down</span>, find a <span class=ref>shadow boundary</span>. This is the <dfn>first divergent boundary</dfn>.</li>
    <li>If <span class=ref>first divergent boundary</span> is not found, stop.</li>
    <li>Set <code>relatedTarget</code> to the parent of the <span class=ref>first divergent boundary</span>.
</ol>
</div>

<h3>Stopped Events</h3>

<p><em>Mutation events</em> and <code>selectstart</code> event are always stopped at the nearest <span class=ref>shadow boundary</span>.</p>
