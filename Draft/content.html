<h2><span class="secno">4.1</span> <a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p>For some use cases it may be useful if the host element is allowed to have children of its own, that then become part of the rendered component.
Those children could either be regular HTML content (e.g., for a layouting comnponent), 
or components of their own that work hand-in-hand with their parent.
To this end, the shadow DOM may contain one or more content elements that define where those children are to be rendered.</p>

<!-- ==================== -->

<h2><span class="secno">4.2</span> Definition</h2>

<h4>The <dfn id="content" title="content"><code>content</code></dfn> element</h4> 

<div class="element">
<pre class="idl">
interface HTMLContentELement : HTMLElement {
    attribute DOMString     <a href="#content.select">select</a>;
}
</pre>
</div>


<p><code><dfn id="content.select" title="select">select</dfn></code> defines which children of the host element are to be displayed in position of the <code>content</code> element.
It contains a space-separated list of <span>simple selector sequences</span>. Every such sequence may contain:</p>
<ul class="brief">
    <li>element selector or universal selector</li>
    <li>class selector(s)</li>
    <li>ID selector</li>
    <li>attribute selector(s)</li>
    <li>pseudo-class selector(s), with certain exceptions (see below)</li>
</ul>

<p>
It MUST NOT contain pseudo-element selectors. If present such a <span>selector sequence</span> is disregarded in its entirety.
</p>

<p>
The following pseudo-classes require special treatment:
<dl>
    <dt>:link
    <dd>This pseudo-class MUST NOT be honored if the component is <a href="./confinement.html">confined</a>, in order to avoid leaking browsing history. If present, the whole selector sequence is disregarded in its entirety.
    <dt>:visited
    <dd>This pseudo-class MUST NOT be honored if the component is <a href="./confinement.html">confined</a>, in order to avoid leaking browsing history. If present, the whole selector sequence is disregarded in its entirety.
    <dt>:hover
    <dd>The user agent MAY honor this pseudo-class, but moving an element that is hovered may likely cause it end up no longer being hovered, likely making this not a useful functionality.
        If the component is <a href="./confinement.html">confined</a>, this pseudo-class MUST NOT be honored, and selector sequences containing it are disregarded.
    <dt>:active
    <dd>The user agent MAY honor this pseudo-class, moving an element that is being activated is likely not a useful functionality.
        If the component is <a href="./confinement.html">confined</a>, this pseudo-class MUST NOT be honored, and selector sequences containing it are disregarded.
    <dt>:focus
    <dd>This pseudo-class MUST NOT be honored if the component is <a href="./confinement.html">confined</a>, and selector sequences containing it are disregarded.
    <dt>:target
    <dd>This pseudo-class MUST NOT be honored if the component is <a href="./confinement.html">confined</a>, and selector sequences containing it are disregarded.
</dl>
</p>

<p>
A <code><a href="#content">content</a></code> element without a <code><a href="#content.select">select</a></code> attribute selects all children
that are not selected by any other <code><a href="#content">content</a></code> element.
A given shadow tree MUST contain only at most a single <code><a href="#content">content</a></code> element without a <code>select</code> attribute. 
In case there are more than one such <code><a href="#content">content</a></code> elements, only the first such content element selects any children.
</p>

<p>
A <code><a href="#content">content</a></code> element may have content of its own,
which is rendered in the case the <code><a href="#content">content</a></code> element doesn't select any children of the host element.
